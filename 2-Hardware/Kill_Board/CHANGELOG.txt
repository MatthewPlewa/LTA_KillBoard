Hardware revision history for the ISU LTA Killboard

Revision D:
 * Moved voltage sense divider to the manually switched battery supply and out from the NMOS switched ground
    -> When NMOS switches removed ground potential, the center of the divider approached
       battery voltage, which could damage the Synapse analog inputs
 * Changed C3 capacitor brands & voltage rating
    -> Old capacitor was EOLd by the manufacturer. Changed to a 25V rating so board is now
       capable of distributing voltages up to ~25V.
 * Tweaked the value of R10 to give 2.7V sensed on the Synapse when battery is 8.0V

Revision C:
 * Added 330R resistor on top of the NMOS-PMOS totem pole driver
    -> Required to limit current through the MOSFETs since there was visible smoking of
       MOSFETs during testing
 * Changed C5 footprint to have a split pad on the +3.3V trace to remove poser from Synapse modules
    -> C5 only necessary when an Xbee module is used, and Synapse modules have pin 14 as
       no-connect. Removed because we were unfamilliar with the Synapse modules and did
       not want to damage them accidentally.

Revision B:
 * Swapped NPN-PNP totem pole driver for a NMOS-PMOS totem pole driver
    -> NPN-PNP combination burnt-up during testing

Revision A:
 * Initial hardware version
